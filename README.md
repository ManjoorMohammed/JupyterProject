"This data analysis project was undertaken as a part of my Data Science and Analytics course, and it was executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The primary objective of this project was to analyze a dataset containing information about employees working in ABC Company. The dataset consisted of 458 rows and 9 columns, and it required thorough preprocessing and analysis to derive meaningful insights.

Throughout this project, we conducted various data preprocessing tasks, including standardizing team names, generating random heights, and segregating employees by their positions. Our analysis also involved answering several key questions such as identifying the teams and positions with the highest salary spending, determining the age group most employees belong to, and investigating any correlation between age and salary.

Here's a summary of the steps in text form:

Data Preprocessing and Team Splitting:

Ensure consistency in team names by capitalizing and stripping spaces.
Calculate the number of employees in each team and the percentage of employees in each team relative to the total number of employees.
Segregate Employees by Position:

Create separate data subsets for each unique position within the company.
Age Group Analysis:

Find the age group with the highest number of employees. This involves categorizing employees into age groups and counting the number in each group.
Identify Team and Position with Highest Salary Spending:

Determine the team and position where the company spends the most in terms of salary.
Correlation Between Age and Salary:

Analyze whether there is a correlation between employees' ages and their salaries using a scatter plot and correlation coefficient.

The use of Jupyter Notebook allowed for an interactive and documented exploration of the dataset, making it a valuable tool for data analysis in the field of Data Science and Analytics."
